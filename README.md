# üè† Housing Data REST API (Spring Boot + MySQL)

This project is a **REST API** built with **Spring Boot** that processes housing data from a JSON file (`housing_data.json`) and stores it into a **MySQL database**.  
It provides endpoints to query housing prices (average, maximum, location-based) **directly using SQL queries** instead of Java calculations.
